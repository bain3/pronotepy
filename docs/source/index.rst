Introduction
------------

This is a Python API wrapper for the PRONOTE student administration service. Every function was tested on a student account, but the API should support teacher, parent or any other account.

.. note:: This project does **not** use the HYPERPLANNING API provided by PRONOTE, because its main goal is to make programming with PRONOTE a lot easier for students who are still learning.
